My spotify-assistant was created to test the Spotify API and to simplify some tasks you normally do manually
using the Spotify desktop or mobile app. I will use python and [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)
a library for the Spotify Web API to build most of the features my little assistant will offer in the near future.
As always, pull requests or other ways of contributing to this repo are welcomed.
